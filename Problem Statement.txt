a. Create a single linked list of at least 10 nodes. The values in the nodes are not in sorted order of any kind
b. Now sort the linked list in descending order. Do not swap the values of nodes to sort, but instead unlink the actual nodes and re-link them so that the final list is sorted.
c. Do linked list traversal from head  : first before sort , then a second time after sort.
d. submit the code.  Also submit screen shot of execution results.
